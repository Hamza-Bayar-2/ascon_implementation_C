ASCON is a state-of-the-art authenticated encryption algorithm designed specifically for the Internet of Things (IoT). It has been designed to provide high-security while also being lightweight and efficient, making it ideal for use in IoT devices with limited resources.

ASCON has recently been named as a finalist in the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) competition for a new standard for authenticated encryption. The winner of this competition will be announced in the fall of 2022.

This repository contains an implementation of ASCON in the C programming language. It is intended for use by developers and researchers who are interested in using ASCON in their own projects or studying its implementation.

ASCON is designed to be highly secure and efficient, making it well suited for use in a wide range of IoT devices, from small sensor nodes to more powerful gateways and hubs. Its lightweight and efficient design also makes it well suited for use in low-power devices with limited resources.

Overall, ASCON is a promising new authenticated encryption algorithm for the Internet of Things and we believe it has the potential to become a widely adopted standard in the future. The code provided in this repository is intended to be a useful resource for developers and researchers interested in working with ASCON, and we hope it will help to accelerate the adoption of this important new technology.
